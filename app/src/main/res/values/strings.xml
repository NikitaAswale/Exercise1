    <string name="story_1">In 2019, exactly 7 years ago, a smart, hardworking and beautiful girl from a small town called Tumsar near Nagpur took admission to G.H. Raisoni College of Engineering and Management, Pune 😊\n\nFirst year and half of second year, everything was new. Just when people started getting used to college life, Corona hit and around 1.5 years everyone studied from home 😷\n\nThen in the last year, everyone came back. New friends, new memories, project submissions, late night chats before exams 🤭 and so much more 😄\n\nI think this was the part of her life where she really grew up and learned so many things about life, about people, and most importantly about herself 🙂</string>

    <string name="story_3">After college, this girl got her first job at Capgemini and moved to Mumbai 😮\n\nImagine, a girl from a small town near Nagpur, now living in the biggest city of the country all by herself. New office, new people, new everything. \n\nI know if it was any other girl she would have been scared, but not this one. She was actually excited about it 😄\n\nShe worked really hard there, learned so many new things, handled real projects, and proved to everyone that she belongs here. Mumbai taught her to be independent, to manage everything on her own, and to never give up no matter how tough things get 💪\n\nThat first job was not just a job, it was the start of something big 😊</string>
    <string name="story_4">And now, just around 3 months ago, she got a new job at Infosys, Pune 😃\n\nAfter Mumbai, she came back to Pune, the city where her college journey started. But this time, she came back stronger and better 🤭\n\nAll that hard work, all those late nights, all the struggles finally paid off. She made it to one of the biggest IT companies in the country and honestly, nobody is surprised because she deserved every bit of it 🙂\n\nShe is still learning, still growing, and still being the same hardworking girl she always was. But now with more confidence, more experience, and a bigger smile on her face 😄\n\nThis is just the beginning. The best is yet to come, and honestly, the world is not ready for what she is about to do 🤗</string>
    <string name="story_5">And talking about myself...\n\nThank you for being my best friend at the times when I needed it the most. You have always been there ...\n\nOnce again, wishing you Many Many Happy Returns of the Day to my Dear Friend and upcoming Android Developer 🎉\n\nAnd also...\n\nCongratulations on completing your Silver Jubilee of 25 Years!! ✨🥳🥂</string>
